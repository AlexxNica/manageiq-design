- Exact numbers of requests and services can be collapsed onto a single card
- If it is possible to store and retrieve past data, the dashboard should be updated to include trend information

### Implementation Details
  - Data that add up to a whole should be represented with either an area chart or a donut chart
    - When the data is useful for looking at historical trends, it should be displayed in an area chart.
    - When data is useful primarily because of its current state, it should be displayed in a donut chart.
