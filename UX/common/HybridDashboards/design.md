### Dashboard Cards

- Report-based cards should remain as they currently are.
- Cards based on real-time data should replace the note in the lower left corner with the phrase "Real-time Data"
- If a real-time card still needs to make requests or check for new data periodically rather than "push" updating, the card should include a button to refresh on command.
